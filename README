Waterloo Math Work Report LaTeX Template

This is a /simple/ template for waterloo work reports in the Faculty of Mathematics.
Clone it, look at "lorem.tex" for sample and make sure to include "mathwkrpt.sty"
in your own file.

I haven't changed this since 2008, so double check it still fits with the standards.

A demo can be seen here: http://www.thomasdimson.com/lorem.pdf
